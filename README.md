My personal site to show about me, contact and projects.

Goal: I want it to be as fast and as accessible as possible. I also want to learn how to make static sites with HTML, SCSS/CSS and Javascript!

### Stuff I Learned (Unordered)

- As of mid 2020, `.tff`, `.woff`, `.woff2` fonts are needed for the widest modern browser compatibility (no I.E). [Useful thread about this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24990554/how-to-include-a-font-ttf-using-css)
- When using custom web fonts, it takes time to load them! In the mean time, it's best to default to system fonts which can be done simply by adding `font-display: swap;` to all `@font-face` rule sets! [Source](https://web.dev/font-display/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools)
